Description
-----------
play-ebean module adds Ebean ORM to as an alternative to Hibernate. It is still in very experimental stage.
Since Ebean uses JPA annotations as Hibernate no change in model shuould be done in general.

Configuration
-------------
1. Install the ebean module
2. add 'module.ebean=${play.path}/modules/ebean' in application.conf file 

See example applications included with the module


Usage: I'd tried to mimic the way standard JPAPlugin does the things. There's aEbeanSupport class which is enhanced
with helper methods with names and parameters as in JPASupport where possible. There's also Model class which adds id field
for all of its descendants. Also JPASupport implements play.db.Model interface which gives the possibility to use CROD
module as well as Fixtures.

However there are differences in usage of EbeanPlugin compared to standard JPAPlugin, the biggest being is that Ebean
does not suport JPA query. Here is what ebean docs say:

	Ebean has it's own query language. Prior to this decision JPQL (the JPA query language)
	was investigated to see if it would meet the desired goals of Ebean and it did not.
	Specifically I wanted to support “Partial Objects” via the query language and it is difficult to
	see how JPQL will evolve to support this (specifically difficulties around its select clause).

I've ported two play! example applications to use ebean: yabe and zencontact. Any feedback is welcome.
